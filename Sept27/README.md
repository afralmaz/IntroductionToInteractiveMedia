# Sept27 Homework Documentation

### The process

Because this homework has been quite the shift from our regular homeworks for me due to the addition of data visualization and the specifics of it, I did not know where to begin.  Because on the previous homeworks, I would at least have a rough image (not an idea) of what I wanted to do even though the project would turn out to become something entirely different. Furthermore, on the previous homeworks, I could just start coding without thinking too much and just play with the elements a lot and appreciate the final result. This time, however, I believed I was forced to think about what kind of visualization it should be and what kind of data I should fetch from the web.  

As I was looking for a good database that could give me a valid data from which I could build something from, I totally changed my mind. I realized that I wanted to generate and display poetry through code. But how can I do that?
