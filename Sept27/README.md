# Sept27 Homework Documentation

### The process

Because this homework has been quite the shift from our regular homeworks for me due to the addition of data visualization and the specifics of it, I had no idea what I wanted to do. Because on the previous homeworks, I would at least have an idea on what I wanted to do even though the project would turn out to become something entirely different. 
Furthermore, on the previous homeworks, I could just start coding without little thoughts and just play with the elements a lot and appreciate the final result. This time, however, I was forced to think about what kind of visualization it should be and what kind of data I should fetch from the web.
