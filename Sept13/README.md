# Sept13 Homework Documentation

### The process

This homework started somewhat slowly for me, because even though I have completely familiarized myself with the `while()` and `for()` loops in Processing, I had no idea what made a code an art. To find out, I have started to do some research on it. Before I started my reading, here were some of the questions I had in my head:
  - To be an art, does something have to be extremely aesthetic?
  - To be an art, does something have to have an intrinsic value?
  - To be an art, does it have to be incomprehensible?
  - How can a piece of code be an art?
