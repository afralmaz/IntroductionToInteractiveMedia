# Sept13 Homework Documentation

### The process

This homework started somewhat slowly for me, because even though I have completely familiarized myself with the `while()` and `for()` loops in Processing, I had no idea what made a code an art. To find out, I have started to do some research on it. Before I started my reading, here were some of the questions I had in my head:
  - To be an art, does something have to be extremely aesthetic?
  - To be an art, does something have to have an intrinsic value?
  - To be an art, does it have to be incomprehensible?
  - How can a piece of code be an art?

I have seen a piece of urinal being presented as an artwork by Marcel Duchamp. If a simple urinal made in a factory can be an art, then perhaps a code can be an art. But how? Therefore, I have decided to read Marcel Duchamp's works to understand the reasoning behind. 

In his definitions, an artist is a mediumistic being. Duchamp states that "we must deny him (the artist) the state of consciousness on the esthetic plane about what he is doing or why he is doing it". In other words, to create an artwork, the artist must enter in this state of trance during which they can't and shouldn't explain themselves. As the artist is purely the medium, the artist's vision should be divorced of the spectator's judgement of the work. Throughout art history, the virtues of an artwork has been completely separate from the rationalized explanations of the artist. 

Therefore, to create this code-art, I have to fulfill my role as a medium. I should not have any rationalizations of this artwork, nor should it affect my final result. I know of the methods I should use to create this artwork (through Processing, with the use of `for` and `while` loops). So I should just strap in and start the process.
