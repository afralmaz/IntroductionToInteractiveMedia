# Nov 18 Homework Documentation

### The concept
Building a musical instrument was kind of unimaginable for someone who doesn't know much about musical instruments like me. But after giving it some thought, I started thinking of musical instruments as nothing but tools to produce sound waves in varying frequencies. This new definition might be a little too technical and not so accurate, but it helped me get started on the assignment. 

### The process

At first, I wanted my circuit to have some buttons such that when they're pressed, they would emit different sound waves. But after some time after I started to build it (see below for the picture of my circuit's initial state), I've seen that it makes the circuit difficult for user interaction due to the buttons being almost impossible to touch, let alone play music with. Therefore, I drew upon some ideas from my first Arduino assignment, and used some other form of conductors (wires taped to a tin foil) than a button. With the new switches, I was able to make a table keyboard that reads from an LDR input and changes the pitches depending on the environment brightness.

### Problems I have encountered and their workarounds

As I've mentioned before, my breadboard was too little to make room for 5 or more buttons. But I recalled from my first Arduino assignment and optimized the space by using wires. 

As this circuit had a lot of components, it was very easy to get lost when something was not working. When I encountered this problem, I used the classic debugging method of taking them all apart and putting them together one by one to see if it works. It was effective!

### Interesting things I've learned

By working on this assignment I have made an observation that that too many components in a circuit makes it hard for interaction unless the components in the circuit were well organized. We don't have to start planning how to make it organized from the beginning, though. Perhaps it suffices to create an unorganized circuit to check if it's functioning properly at first, and move on to organize the circuit.
