# November 4 Homework Documentation

### The process

For this homework, I needed the code and the circuit together to make it work. For the code, I wrote a code that turned the blue LED on when the button switch wasn't pressed and the green LED on when the button switch was pressed. Then, I built the circuit with a button switch to work with the code (see Video 1 below). But I was stumped on not knowing how  I could push the button without using my hands. Then, I remembered the video that had been showed to us during class. The person in the video was using their mouth as a switch! Strangely enough, I saw no buttons in the video. Then I saw that I did not properly know how a switch worked. After understanding how switches really worked, I removed the button to replace the switch with two wires and got it to work (see Video 2 below). 

### The problems I encountered

At first, my problem was not properly knowing how a switch worked. But after carefully looking at the circuit schematics distributed to us during classes, I understood how switches worked. I used this new understanding of the concept to build the second circuit, which had its button switch replaced by two wires. 

### Interesting things I have learned

The key thing that I learned while working on this assignment is that the switch is just a component that connects and disconnects the circuit. We discussed about this in class, but I hadn't properly understood the concept until I worked on the assignment. The switch can be any two electric conductive materials that can touch (ON) and not touch (OFF).
