# Sept22 Homework Documentation

### The process

Before I started my work on this project, I was extremely tempted to re-use my last homework code since I have learned that what I did on the previous homework is a generative artwork. I could have just made the circle and the line in the previous code separate Objects and be done with it. However, that seemed a bit uninspired to me, and I really wanted to get my hands on the new functions I've learned from the Homework Readings (`rotate()`, `scale()`, and `translate()`). Therefore, I reset my whole canvas.
