# Final Project Documentation

### The proposal

Ever since this class started, I have been yearning for building things and seeing how a piece of code in my computer can interact with the real world. 
Therefore, I was excited when we started working with Arduino, and learning how we can interface between Arduino and Processing was the cherry on top.
Ever since the first class we had, since Michael introduced us the syllabus to us, highlighting some sample final projects, I knew I wanted to be able to build robots by the end of the class.
So, I propose to build a small robot that is controlled through my computer in Processing. Since the robot needs to be mobile, we'll use a radio component to communicate between 2 Arduino microcontrollers: one hooked up to the Processing in my computer and transmitting the message, the other in the robot, receiving the message. Overall, I am extremely excited to see how my project turns out. I am teaming up with my classmate Afra Almazroui for this project.
